### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/nostr-valley.git
   cd nostr-valley
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Relay System

Nostr Valley implements a sophisticated multi-relay fetching system that queries content from multiple Nostr relays simultaneously:

**Primary Relays:**
- `wss://relay.nostr.band`
- `wss://ditto.pub/relay`
- `wss://relay.damus.io`
- `wss://relay.primal.net`
- `wss://nos.lol`
- `wss://relay.snort.social`

**Benefits:**
- **Enhanced Content Discovery**: Find content that might only exist on specific relays
- **Improved Reliability**: Continue working even if some relays are down
- **Better Performance**: Parallel fetching with intelligent deduplication
- **Network Resilience**: Geographic distribution and load balancing
